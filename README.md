Small and easy Java program (not finished yet) to train musical ear on a guitar neck.
It looks like this http://joxi.ru/Q2K4DDkT4G01VA:
1. Button "Ear Trainer" is followed with a sound of note which you shoud to guess by pressing the fret. If you're wrong the note will be red - like this http://joxi.ru/KAg077Rc43Vdyr. But if you're right the note will be green.
2. Button "Show notes" shows all notes on guitar neck - like this http://joxi.ru/ZrJ4OOxT90Nj82.
